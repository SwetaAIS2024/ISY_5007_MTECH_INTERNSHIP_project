  Long-name                hailonet element
  Klass                    Hailo/Network
  Description              Configure and Activate Hailo Network. Supports the "flush" signal which blocks until there are no buffers currently processesd in the element. When deactivating a hailonet during runtime (via set_property of "is-active" to False), make sure that no frames are being pushed into the hailonet, since this operation waits until there are no frames coming in.

                        Unsigned Integer. Range: 0 - 16 Default: 0 
  device-count        : Number of physical devices to use. Excludes device-id.
                        flags: readable, writable
                        Unsigned Integer. Range: 1 - 65535 Default: 0

  force-writable      : Controls whether the element will force the input buffer to be writable. We force the input to be writable with the function gst_buffer_make_writable, which in most cases will do a shallow copy of the buffer. But in some cases (when the buffer is marked as not shared - see gst_buffer_copy documentation), it will do a deep copy.By default, the hailonet element will not force the input buffer to be writable and will raise an error when the buffer is read-only.
