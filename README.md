## Project Title: AI-on-EDGE for Traffic Management System
### Internship Work Description:
The aim of this project is to use Edge AI chips with traffic cameras to perform real-time monitoring of traffic, to retrieve useful data about traffic flow that can be used as a foundation for further analytics.


The project will utilize Hailo AI chips and the scope for the internship includes :
 
- Lane Congestion Monitoring — Use computer vision to detect congestion and traffic flow patterns in each lane and feed this data into the smart traffic management system.
- Model Conversion & Optimization — Convert custom user-defined AI models into a Hailo compatible executable format using the Hailo Dataflow Compiler for inference on Raspberry Pi with the Hailo ecosystem. This is required, in order to run any model file even if they are not in the Hailo model library.
- License Plate Recognition System — Implement license plate recognition algorithms as part of advanced computer vision tasks.
