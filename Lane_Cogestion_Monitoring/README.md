# Lane_Congestion_Monitoring

- Lane Detection with the UFLDv2 : Lane detection using the Ultra Fast Lane Detection v2 model
- Object Detection with yolov5m and speed estimation : Already done - used the hailo's example + Roboflow speed estimation , we will leverage the existing work done for the current project.
Roboflow example already incorporates the ByteTrack for tracking the detected objects.
